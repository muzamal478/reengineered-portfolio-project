This is the modern, reengineered version of my portfolio website.

Changes from old version:
- Used Bootstrap for layout and responsiveness
- Improved UI with cards and clean spacing
- Created organized folder structure (assets/css, assets/js, assets/images)
- Added scroll behavior and button-based navigation
- Modern coding practices used
